# 4ier and 4iest

## Edridge D'Souza, Honors 391H with Prof. Manes

This is a copy of my final project for Honors 391H, involving analysis of 4ier/4iest numbers, extending a pipeline to Nier/Niest numbers, and then introducing analyses of Benford's Law. The Mathematica notebook is included, as well as an HTML copy of the results. For best results, view the notebook interactively in a Wolfram Mathematica notebook. The HTML page will contain all the code and explanations, but the interactive elements (including the dynamic charts and Manipulate[] elements) might not be fully functional.
